## JustStraight

A mod that simply runs straight ahead for you.

This mod helps you travel long distances. You press a button. Your character runs forward.

### Features

*   **Auto Run**. Your character runs straight without you holding a key.
*   **BunnyHop**. Automatically jumps while running.
*   **Auto Eat**. The mod can eat for you when you are hungry. The function is activated when hunger drops below 6 units (3 icons). Movement stops. The mod eats food from your hotbar. Movement resumes after hunger is restored.

### This is not a cheat

This mod does not give you an unfair advantage.
It does not bypass obstacles.
It does not avoid mobs or other threats.
The auto eat feature only takes food from your hotbar.
The mod acts like you are holding down your forward key.
